Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sound is pleasant,
And so are you.

Orchids are white,
Ghost ones are rare,
Hours are long,
And so is your hair.

Magnolia grows,
With buds like eggs,
My history is long,
And so are your legs.

Sunflowers reach,
Up to the skies,
Your head is grey,
And so are your eyes.

Foxgloves in hedges,
Surround the farms,
My neck is slender,
And so are your arms.

Daisies are pretty,
Daffies have style,
Days are warm,
And so is your smile.

A birdsong is beautiful,
Just like you.
