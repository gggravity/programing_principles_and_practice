Hello Potential Hounds

Sorry the system missed the welcome message off your initial message.
I have set up an open mail reflector for the purpose of distributing
information relating to Fox Hunting.  You should have received your
subscription details and a random password.  You can select another
password or leave it as is, you need it to change your options.
The list is unmoderated and anyone can post to it at the present.
If this starts to be abused I can change this.  Use
mailto:foxhunt@happy.emu.id.au to post. By accessing the web interface
you can see who else is on the list.

The first Hunt of the season will be on Thursday the 2nd of November
starting adjacent to the skate bowl outside the griffin centre in
civic at 6:30 pm.  First Fox will be on 146.200 MHz and will commence
transmissions at 6:30, so be there a little before time.  Liaison will
be on the Black Hill repeater 146.900 MHz.  Spare equipment will be
available as usual.

Cheers
Neil Pickford

Hello!

I am Dimitris, VK1KBN. I have never tried fox hunting before but
it's something that I always wanted to do. Anyway, I hope the
first hunt for this season is going to be a success!

Questions now. :) Firstly, what sort of equipment are we going to
use? I only have my FT-50R here in australia.. Is the fox going to
be hidden in walking distance from the griffin centre?

cheers,
dimitris

You need a directional antenna, an attenuator and probably a sniffer
for when you get close.  
All of these are available from the start location near the skate bowl
just before the hunt starts.

> Is the fox going to

Since you have asked, I will make it walking distance from the start
location.  In fact we will probably run 2 hunts on foot this time.

Hi everyone,

thanks to Neil for setting up the mailing list.

Just to reassure everyone, yes we (I and my kids) are interested in 
foxhunts but unfortunately we currently are in the process of preparing a 
house for sale and also have another commitment on Thursday 
nights.  However both distractions will be gone soon and I hope we can join 
in the fun again.  Both my kids were interested when I mentioned it so I 
should have an interested crew.

Oh yes.  I sold the car that had an antenna and a radio in it.
Have not yet reinstalled into another car.
Fortunately that doesn't matter too much.

And we have moved to Oxley.  No changes to email or postal address, still 
as per callbook.  No antennas up yet in fact the radios are still in boxes...

cheers all

The weather is holding a bit at present so I still intend running 
the fox hunt tonight.  Start time is 6:30 PM in Civic near Skate bowl
Griffin centre car park.  Looks like it will be a pedestrian hunt.

Last Weeks Hunt went off successfully with 3 Hounds and 
3 Hunts.  The weather held back for the first two hunts 
(almost) but it bucketed down during the third.  Luckily 
there was shelter in the form of the Arts Centre Porch 
where the successful hounds could wait for the other hounds.
Neil transported the Hounds back to their starting point
so they did not get too wet.

Report
The first location originally saw the fox buried in the top
of a pile of wood chips, however the rain soaked wood chips
absorbed too much RF and the hounds could not hear it.
Neil went back and moved it to a more open location in a
grass tussock near the environment centre.  The Hounds Quickly
found their way to the area with a choice of which side to be
made.  John VK1ET chose the wrong side and so after circling
the complex ended up last.  Kerri VK1TKR & Dimitris VK1KBN 
arrived first.

The second fox was substantially weaker, again due to wet 
vegetation, so Neil gave the pedestrian hounds a few clews
to get them in range.  Even so Kerri never heard this one and 
proceeded straight to the third fox location.  John was first
on the scene of the second fox, finding the long antenna wound 
along the branches of a low bush near a chain mesh fence in Mort 
Street.  Dimitris had a difficult time with this one as he was
looking for a box not an antenna, and kept ignoring the higher
level readings.  He did however find it in the end.  
Those last couple of meters can be real difficult!

It was at this point the Downpour began, Dimitris decided to 
continue, and Neil loaned him his GoreTex.  Hounds arrived at 
the final location, a hedge next to the Arts Centre (Old 
Questacon Building) in the order Kerri, John and Dimitris.
Lets hope this is the last hunt to have rain this year!

Next Hunt
Well this week I am scheduling another Hunt for Thursday 
night.  6:30 PM start again from near the skate bowl in the
griffin centre carpark.  As usual spar equipment will be 
available for hounds who don't have a full set of gear.
Bring at least a 2M hand held.  The first hunt will be on
146.200 MHz commencing at 6:30 PM.  Liaison repeater is
VK1RAC 146.900 MHz Black Hill.

We might move the December Hunts to another location because 
Civic these days is a rather RF dirty location.
Any suggestions are welcome.

Tonight's Fox Hunt is ON.
It will start at 6:30 PM outside the skate bowl
in the car park near the griffin centre in civic.

I have repaired the 3rd sniffer so I will have 
all 3 sniffers operational and available tonight.

I am planning to go to Sizzler Belconnen with Tom
VK1TS for a feed afterwards.  
Anyone else who wants to come along your welcome.

I have had an expression of interest in a Hunt happening
this Thursday evening.  I am available but am seeking feedback
from others who are available.  

I originally did not schedule a hunt for this night as it 
clashed with the CAAS meeting, however in practice there has 
not been an overlap of recent participants.

If people would like to start at a quieter RF location then
let the list know.  We have started in Weston park previously.

This week we had 1 Fox VK1KNP and 1 hound VK1ET with 
apologies from Kerri VK1TKR and Dimitris VK1KBN who each had 
work/study commitments on the night.

However all was not lost with Neil and John swapping roles as Fox
and Hound with hunts 2,3 & 4 happening some-what in parallel.
Hunting this night was vehicle based with lots of stops.  
I must put my fox-hunting roof rack attachment back on!

The hunts quickly moved out of the noisy Civic area and ended up in
Ainslie at the foot of Mount Ainslie.  We even managed to find
a substation that neither of us knew existed!

A total of Four hunts took place 2 on each frequency finishing up
around 8:30 PM.

Cheers
Neil VK1KNP

I asked a few people at the meeting Monday if there was any interest
in Fox Hunting this week, I have not had any takers so no hunt tonight.

I plan there will be a hunt next week on Thursday night 7/12/2000

This one will start in Weston Park Yarralumla in the car park
adjacent to the MAZE & next to the railway.

Start time will be 6:30 pm and if you like, be prepared for a BBQ
afterwards.

Fox Hunt Report for Thursday 7th December 2000.

This Hunt took place in Weston Park Yarralumla starting at the Maze
carpark.
  
The Fox went on air at 6:45 pm and only one hound was at the 
meeting point.  John VK1ET set off on foot followed by Neil 
VK1KNP who decided to test an antenna and sniffer that was part 
of Tom VK1BUDs deceased estate.  Although Neil knew the location 
of the fox, normal techniques with TOM's antenna and the hand held 
did not work until we figured out it was a null type antenna.  

Two equal length folded dipoles connected antiphase with same 
length matching sections.  Even having figured out the principle 
did not help greatly as there is no front to back discrimination 
of the signal.

The fox had been placed on the far side of Yarralumla Nursery and
we encountered the chain mail fence which appeared to be radiating
the fox signal.  This further confused the readings out of the 
Null antenna.  As murphy's law would have it, we picked the long 
way around the fence ending up 1/2 way back to the starting 
location before clearing the obstacle at the lakes edge.  

After about 1/2 an hour the fox was located in a heap of garden 
mulch by John.  Neil was still trying to figure out the operation 
of Toms sniffer at this time.  

Tom's sniffer is an amplified tuned diode detector circuit with a 
large 1 ma analog meter.  The meter works well at showing the nulls 
but it takes a bit more practice to interpret the peaks.

John took the fox and hid it nearby, while Neil retuned and looked 
at the calibration of the sniffer.  Then Neil used Tom's equipment
to find the Fox.  All was going well with Neil following a strong 
null until he realised that he was DFing Black Mountain Tower, not
the Fox.  A quick retune of the sniffer yielded multiple null
directions, some towards Black Mt and others slightly divergent.
The divergent signals were followed and after a big spiral in on 
the fox location a mysterious heap of cut grass below a tree was
investigated, No Fox!  
Further Dfing showed the fox to be up the tree.  
Neil had been fooled by the obvious red herring John had placed.

It was found that pointing the folded ends of the the dipoles of 
the null type antenna directly at the source causes the null to 
disappear.  This can be used in the near field to determine if 
the fox is up or down.

Finally John had a try of Tom's equipment after Neil re-hid the fox. 
Similar problems with Black Mt were experienced drawing John well
off course.  Once John was within 40 m of the fox he began to get
better readings leading him to the base of a tree.  After searching
the grass, John found it hard to decide if the Fox was indeed up the
tree, however after some careful Null replotting he determined it
had to be in the grass, and this time found the Fox.

Neil and John retired for a BBQ after the 3rd Hunt.

This was probably the last Hunt for this year, although if there
is serious interest on the reflector I may schedule another one
before January 2001

All the best for Christmas
Neil VK1KNP

Neil and others,

I have a practical 'fox' for you.

While I sit in my shack trying to listen to the new AO-40 satellite on
145.899+-, there is a chirp tone that JUST moves the needle on my IC-260A
(fed from either the quarter-wave or 5/8.

It's about a 1 second interval. 

It seems to sit on 145.8995 when I use USB.

Please feel free to walk the streets around my place and find where the
wretched thing lives.

My guess: the timing circuits of a clock in a piece of electronic equipment
in a house nearby.

Is anyone interested in tracking it down?
Would you loan me your equipment and teach me how to do it?

With thanks in anticipation,

Peter Ellis	22 Belconnen Way

I've had it there with nothing else on... (including flouro lights, and that
my computers were stone-cold)

Did I mention that I've heard it 'START'... ?

		> If theres no hunt this thursday I'll borrow a sniffer from
neil. 

Let me check Thursday evening and get back to you (all.)

Dear sir/madam,
    I am doing a talk for my class at school about fox hunting, and was
wondering if in any chance you could send me some infromation. You
couldeither email me back on my address or write to me to my home address:
8, The Downs, Blue Bell Hill, Chatham, Kent. ME5 9RA. If you could possibly
send me a leaflet on  the topic and other bits of information. iF you could
then it would be extremly helpful. If this is the wrong address Iam emailing
to could you then give me the proper site to email to.
    Thankyou very much
     Aliyah -

Hi Andrew, same thing happened to me. I did note that the email 
requested a posted response, but wanted to clarify if , since it 
appeared to be from the UK, that it was what we consider foxhunting 
rather than the pursuit of furry animals.

regards,
Bryan Ackerly

find out more about "foxhunts"  I have done a number on CB which is a =
little different to AR! from what I have read.

Is there any event in Brisbane or Sydney that I can get along to.  Also =
I would like to organise my own some time in the future, so if anyone =
has any planning ideas please let me know.

I was also wondering how you set up the "fox"??? I have seen something =
on the web that you plug into your handheld, I have sent an e-mail to =
the address with no reply as yet.  Are they still available or is there =
another way of setting up the "fox"??

Thankyou for letting me join the e-mail group.  Hope to hear from you =
soon.


Cheers Bob
VK4JMP/VK2JMP.
